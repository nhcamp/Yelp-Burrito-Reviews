# Yelp-Burrito-Reviews
This project works with Yelp's massive Open Dataset. Goal of the project was twofold. 1. Build a classifer that predicts Yelp star rating based on text. 2. Use sentiment analysis to identify undervalued establishments - low star rating, high sentiment reviews. You'll find project write ups in "Capstone 2 Project...", a proposal in "Capstone 2 Project Proposal", code in "Capstone 2.ipynb" and a powerpoint in the .pptx file. Three write ups on Medium: https://towardsdatascience.com/yelps-best-burritos-aafb0eba74da?source=friends_link&sk=cfe3a952f905bc0194b65ddfda24f290
